🧠TurtleBot Traffic Sign Following

A ROS2-based TurtleBot project that detects traffic signs (STOP, LEFT, RIGHT) using OpenCV and controls robot motion using a state-machine–based controller.

This project combines computer vision and robot motion control to create a simple but realistic autonomous driving behavior for educational purposes.

🚀 Features:

Real-time traffic sign detection using camera input

Color-based vision (HSV) with OpenCV

STOP sign handling with highest priority

LEFT / RIGHT direction detection using arrow geometry

State machine–based motion controller

Obstacle avoidance using front distance sensing

Smooth turning and forward maneuvers

Safe emergency stop behavior
